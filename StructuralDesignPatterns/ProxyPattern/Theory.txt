Controls and manages the access to the object for which they are acting as a
proxy. The proxy class have the same interface as the object to which it acts
as proxy. Usually by keeping a reference to that object.


IService { }
ConcreteService : IService { }
ProxyService : IService
{
    ConcreteService concreteService;
}

Extra work can be implemented inside proxy which should be done before or after
calling the actual concrete service object. It can be something like controlling
the access to the service object.
